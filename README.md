# DVWA-Lab-Writeups

This repository contains a collection of write-ups documenting my hands-on experience exploiting known vulnerabilities in the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** and **OWASP Juice Shop**. The write-ups cover various web application security vulnerabilities, such as **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, and more. These labs demonstrate my offensive security skills and the methods used to exploit vulnerable web applications in a controlled environment.

## Vulnerabilities Covered

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
- **And other web vulnerabilities** explored in DVWA and Juice Shop.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download and set up **DVWA** or **OWASP Juice Shop** locally (or use a vulnerable Docker container).
2. Make sure to configure the application to its **vulnerable mode** (DVWA allows you to set the security level).
3. Clone this repository to keep track of my findings and progress.

## Files

- `README.md`: Overview of the repository and setup instructions.
- `XSS.md`: Detailed write-up of how I exploited XSS in DVWA.
- `SQLi.md`: Walkthrough of SQL Injection exploitation.
- `screenshots/`: Folder to store relevant screenshots of exploits (if available).
